        This specification describes a set of cryptographic suites created in
        2020. The suites define representations and interfaces that support
        digital signatures and encryption.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        "We shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us."<br />
        -- Marshall McLuhan
      </p>
      <p>
        These set of suites are designed to addresses the failures of previous
        specifications and the inability of developers to follow simple
        instructions.

        The language we have used to describe cryptography has created security
        issues....

      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
        This section describes the vocabulary used by this suite. Some
        vocabulary is used to describe private data, which must not be made
        public.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>key</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          Generic term refering to cryptographic material. There are symmetric
          and assymmetric keys.
        </dd>

        <dt><dfn data-lt="symmetric key | secret key">symmetric key</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          Cryptrographic material that is used to produce encryptions and
          message authentication codes. Sometimes referred to as a secret key.
        </dd>

        <dt><dfn data-lt="assymmetric key">assymmetric key</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          Ambigious term for cryptrographic material that is used to produce and
          verify signatures and derive information used to produce symmetric
          keys. Used to refer to both the public and private components of a key
          pair.
        </dd>

        <dt><dfn>key pair</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          Generic term used to describe key materials which are associated in
          some way. Commonly used to refer to assymetric cryptographic key
          material, because they always come in pairs.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <dfn data-lt="private key">private key</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          The private component of an assymetric key pair, which is commonly
          used to produce digital signatures and derive bits used to produce
          symmetric keys.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <dfn data-lt="public key">public key</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          The public component of an assymetric key pair, which is commonly used
          to verify digital signatures and derive bits used to produce symmetric
          keys.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>signature suite</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          A specified set of cryptographic primitives typically consisting of a
          canonicalization algorithm, a message digest algorithm, and a
          signature algorithm that are bundled together by cryptographers for
          developers for the purposes of safety and convenience.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>canonicalization algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          An algorithm that takes an input document that has more than one
          possible representation and always transforms it into a
          <a>canonical form</a>. This process is sometimes also called
          normalization.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>canonical form</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          The output of applying a <a>canonicalization algorithm</a> to an input
          document.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <dfn data-lt="message digest algorithm | message digest algorithms"
            >message digest algorithm</dfn
          >
        </dt>
        <dd>
          An algorithm that takes a <a>message</a> and produces a cryptographic
          output message that is often many orders of magnitude smaller than the
          input message. These algorithms are often 1) very fast, 2)
          non-reversible, 3) cause the output to change significantly when even
          one bit of the input message changes, and 4) make it infeasible to
          find two different inputs for the same output.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <dfn data-lt="message digest | message digests">message digest</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          The result of the application of the
          <a>message digest algorithm</a> to a <a>message</a>
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>signature algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          An algorithm that takes an input message and produces an output value
          where the receiver of the message can mathematically verify that the
          message has not been modified in transit and came from someone
          possessing a particular secret.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>encryption algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          An algorithm that takes an input message and produces an output value
          where only the receiver of the output can recover the original message
          and confirm that the message has not been modified in transit and came
          from someone possessing a particular secret.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <dfn data-lt="message | messages">message</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          The input to a cryptographic operation, such as signing, hashing or
          encrypting.
