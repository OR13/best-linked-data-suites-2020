        -- Marshall McLuhan
      </p>
      <p>
        These set of suites are designed to addresses the failures of previous
        specifications and the inability of developers to follow simple
        instructions.

      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
        This section describes the vocabulary used by this suite. Some
        vocabulary is used to describe private data, which must not be made
        public.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>key</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          Generic term refering to cryptographic material. There are symmetric
          and assymmetric keys.

        <dt><dfn data-lt="symmetric key | secret key">symmetric key</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          Cryptrographic material that is used to produce encryptions and
          message authentication codes. Sometimes referred to as a secret key.
        </dd>

        <dt><dfn data-lt="assymmetric key">assymmetric key</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          Ambigious term for cryptrographic material that is used to produce and
          verify signatures and derive information used to produce symmetric
          keys. Used to refer to both the public and private components of a key
          pair.
        </dd>

        <dt><dfn>key pair</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          Generic term used to describe key materials which are associated in
          some way. Commonly used to refer to assymetric cryptographic key
          material, because they always come in pairs.

          <dfn data-lt="private key">private key</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          The private component of an assymetric key pair, which is commonly
          used to produce digital signatures and derive bits used to produce
          symmetric keys.

        <dt><dfn>signature suite</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          A specified set of cryptographic primitives typically consisting of a
          canonicalization algorithm, a message digest algorithm, and a
          signature algorithm that are bundled together by cryptographers for
          developers for the purposes of safety and convenience.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>canonicalization algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          An algorithm that takes an input document that has more than one
          possible representation and always transforms it into a
          <a>canonical form</a>. This process is sometimes also called
          normalization.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>canonical form</dfn></dt>

          An algorithm that takes a <a>message</a> and produces a cryptographic
          output message that is often many orders of magnitude smaller than the
          input message. These algorithms are often 1) very fast, 2)
          non-reversible, 3) cause the output to change significantly when even
          one bit of the input message changes, and 4) make it infeasible to
          find two different inputs for the same output.

        <dd>
          An algorithm that takes an input message and produces an output value

        <dd>
          An algorithm that takes an input message and produces an output value

      <h2>Information Model</h2>

      <p>
        The <a>id</a> property of a <a>key pair</a> identifies a node in an
        information graph which contains both public and private information.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a>type</a> property of a <a>key pair</a> specifies different
        representations of a node in an information graph.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is RECOMMENDED to use the <a>public key</a> or a deterministic
        transformation of a represenation of it for the purpose of identifying a
        <a>key pair</a> via <a>id</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Linked data proofs are nodes in the same information graph as
        <a>key pairs</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a linked data proof is produced, an edge is created between the
        <a>key pair</a> used to produce the proof, and the proof. This edge is
        identified in the proof by the property <a>verificationMethod</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The same <a>key pair</a> MAY be used to create multiple different proof
        types, by applying different algorithms.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, a <code>type</code> of
        <code>Ed25519VerificationKey2020</code> might be used in the
        <a>verification method</a> representation of the public information
        associated with a key pair, however <code>type</code> of
        <code>Ed25519VerificationKey2018</code> might also be used for the same
        graph node. Subsequently, a proof of type
        <code>Ed25519Signature2020</code>, and one of type
        <code>Ed25519Signature2018</code> might be produced and linked to the
        same <a>key pair</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A <a>key pair</a> and a <a>verification method</a> are different
        represenations of the same node in a graph. Different representations of
        a node leverage different <a>type</a> property values to express which
        subset of the information graph is used by the represenation.
      </p>

      <p>
        In simpler language, <a>type</a> is used to distinguish between public
        and private represenations of a <a>key pair</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The graph node attribute <a>type</a> is also used to express the
        intended use of a cryptographic key. For example
        <code>Ed25519VerificationKey2018</code> for signature verification, and
        <code>X25519KeyAgreementKey2019</code> for key agreement. However, both
        represenations can be used to describe the same node in an information
        graph. For more information see

      <h2>Interfaces</h2>

      <p>
        This section describes interfaces used by linked data proof suites. Web
        IDL and JSON-LD are used to describe a data model and interfaces for
        representations.

          Key Pair
        </h2>

        <p>
          A linked data key pair describes an assymetric crypographic key, which
          supports digital signature creation via a private key, public key
          derivation from a private key, signature verification using the public
          key, and secret derivation us both public and private key components.
        </p>

        <p>
          Anyone who has a private key, can derive the public key, but the
          opposite is not true. This is the foundation on which digital
          signatures and key agreement are built, and is the reason that private
          keys must remain private.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <a>type</a> of a linked data key pair allows for control over
          <a>cryptographic agility</a>. A key pair can be restricted to a
          limited set of cryptographic algorithms by defining a new
          <a>type</a> and documenting the restrictions in a
          <a>signature suite</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
          If support for <a>cryptographic agility</a> is desired, a
          <a>signature suite</a> can rely on an external registry for
          cryptographic key and algorithms representations and guidance. For
          example, a suite might reuse the vocabulary defined by

            >IANA JOSE</a
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          The private component of assymetric cryptographic key pairs MUST be
          protected from accidental or intentional disclosure.
